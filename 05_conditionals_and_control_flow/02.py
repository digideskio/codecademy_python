# Assign True or False as appropriate on the lines below!
bool_one = True # 17 < 118 % 100 is equal to 17 < 18, which is True

bool_two = True # 33 * 3 = 99, so 99 + 1 = 100, thus 100 == 100

bool_three = False # 2 ** 4 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 4 * 4 = 16. 19 <= 16 is False

bool_four = False # -22 is less than -18, so it cant be greater than or equal to -18

bool_five = False # 99 equals 98 + 1, so 99 != 99 will evaluate to False.
